Consider the example of the College’s Database which takes care of all the student’s records.
For e.g., we need to find the name of those students from Database whose balance fee if greater than 500.
 So, if we traverse the whole list of students and for each student object
 if we make a separate connection to the database  then it will be proved as an expensive task.
