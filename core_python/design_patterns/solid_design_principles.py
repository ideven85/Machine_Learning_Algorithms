O in SOLID, known as the open-closed principle.
 Simply put, classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs 
in an otherwise happy application.

Of course, the one exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code.

mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later
note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsingâ€™s memorandum.
