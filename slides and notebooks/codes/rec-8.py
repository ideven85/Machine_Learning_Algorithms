############### Data representation

#    rate: int, the sampling rate, in samples per second
#    samples: a list of floats, the samples
sound = {"rate": 8000, "samples": [1, 2, 3]}

# OR:
# sound is a list whose first element is the rate and second is a sublist
# containing the samples
sound = [8000, [1, 2, 3]]

sound[1]

# OR:
# sound is a list whose first element is the rate, and remaining elements the
# samples
sound = [8000, 1, 2, 3]

# OR: (coming later in semester)
# class Sound:
#    ...
# sound = Sound(8000, [1,2,3])
# sound.rate
# sound.samples
# isinstance(sound, Sound) ==> True
