# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction
This project I started for my own, I will be building it further, these are features in it

## Features
- **6_001**: Contains all code from [Mit's 6.101 course](https://py.mit.edu)
- **Sample Projects**: Bacon similar to Neo4j's movie cypher dataset
- **Coding**: More than 250 problems from leetcode and Algoexpert.io. 
- **For algorithms in Java checkout [Java_Coding_Interview](https://github.com/ideven85/Java_Coding_Interview) containing more than 500 problems, LLD designs, and all Java features
- **Machine_Learning**: Many datasets and algorithms like sentiment analysis and many more
- **Vector_Database**: A must checkout for building your own databases for real time searhc
