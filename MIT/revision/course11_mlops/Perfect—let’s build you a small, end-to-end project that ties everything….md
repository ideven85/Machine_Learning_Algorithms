 Perfect—let’s build you a **small, end-to-end project** that ties everything together:  
**MLflow + Airflow + Flask (your MLOps story in one project)**  
This is not academic—this is **resume-grade + interview-ready**.  
  
⸻  
  
## 🚀  
## Project: ML Pipeline with Serving  
**🧠 What this shows**  
You’ll demonstrate:  
* MLflow → experiment tracking  
* Airflow → pipeline orchestration  
* Flask → model serving  
👉 That’s **full MLOps loop**  
  
⸻  
  
## 🧩  
## Architecture (simple)  
```
Airflow DAG
   ↓
Train Model → Log with MLflow
   ↓
Save Model
   ↓
Flask API loads model
   ↓
Prediction endpoint

```
  
⸻  
  
## 🟢  
## Step 1: Train + MLflow (your existing ML)  
```
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X, y = [[1], [2], [3]], [0, 1, 0]

with mlflow.start_run():
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)

    acc = model.score(X, y)

    mlflow.log_param("model", "logistic")
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", acc)

    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

```
👉 Now you have:  
* experiment  
* model saved  
  
⸻  
  
## 🟢  
## Step 2: Airflow DAG (orchestration)  
```
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def train():
    import train_mlflow  # your script

with DAG("ml_pipeline", start_date=datetime(2024,1,1), schedule="@daily") as dag:
    train_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="train_model",
        python_callable=train
    )

```
👉 This makes your ML:  
* automated  
* scheduled  
  
⸻  
  
## 🟢  
## Step 3: Flask API (your strength)  
```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import mlflow.sklearn

app = Flask(__name__)

model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model("runs:/<run_id>/model")

@app.route("/predict", methods=["POST"])
def predict():
    data = request.json["input"]
    pred = model.predict([data])
    return jsonify({"prediction": int(pred[0])})

```
👉 This = **production serving**  
  
⸻  
  
## 🟢  
## Step 4: Connect your story (VERY IMPORTANT)  
You don’t need perfect integration—just show flow:  
* Airflow triggers training  
* MLflow tracks experiment  
* Flask serves model  
👉 That’s enough  
  
⸻  
  
## 🧾  
## How to write this in resume  
Add:  
**ML Pipeline (MLOps Project)**  
* Built end-to-end ML pipeline using **Airflow (orchestration), MLflow (tracking), and Flask (serving)**  
* Automated model training workflows using **Airflow DAGs**  
* Tracked experiments and versioned models using **MLflow**  
* Deployed model as **REST API using Flask** for real-time inference  
  
⸻  
  
## 🧠  
## Interview answer (use this)  
I built a simple MLOps pipeline where Airflow orchestrates training jobs, MLflow tracks experiments and versions models, and Flask serves the model via APIs.  
  
⸻  
  
## ⚡  
## Why this is perfect for YOU  
You already have:  
* Flask ✅  
* Systems thinking ✅  
Now you add:  
* MLflow (tracking)  
* Airflow (pipeline)  
👉 You become:  
**Complete MLOps Engineer (practical, not theoretical)**  
  
⸻  
  
## 🔥 Final advice  
Don’t try to perfect this.  
👉 Even a **basic working version = enough to pass interviews**  
  
⸻  
  
If you want next: I can:  
* Turn this into a **GitHub-ready project (with folder structure + README)**  
* Or integrate this into your **resume perfectly**  
Just say 👍
